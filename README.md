# Process Dashboard Mobile Companion

Process Dashboard works like JIRA. It is an open source TSP supporting tool developed by [David Tuma](dtuma).

TSP is a software development process from Carnegie Mellon University.

This project adds mobile apps to the legacy desktop rich client.

I am responsible for:
- The iOS app
- iOS & Android: Time Tracking Model
- iOS & Android: Settings and database storage

#Current status: 
- iOS app is currently available on the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/process-dashboard-companion/id1141093734?mt=8)
- Android app was available on the MarketPlace but currently taken down to update.

#Further plans:
- iOS app will be made more nice looking
- Android app will be tested on Android Nougat
- Contributors (students) are looking for jobs so the the work is currently suspended

This forked repository is a personal backup and all new contributions will be made onto the original repository.
